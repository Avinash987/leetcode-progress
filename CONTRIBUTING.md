# Contributing to LeetCode Progress

Thank you for your interest in this repository! This guide will help you add new solutions.

## 📋 Quick Start

1. **Choose the right difficulty folder**
   - `Easy/` for Easy problems
   - `Medium/` for Medium problems
   - `Hard/` for Hard problems

2. **Create a problem folder**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p [Difficulty]/[number]-[problem-name]
   ```
   Example: `mkdir -p Easy/1-two-sum`

3. **Add your solution files**
   - `README.md` - Problem description and approach
   - `solution.[ext]` - Your solution code
   - (Optional) `test.[ext]` - Test cases

## 📝 File Templates

### README.md Template

```markdown
# [Number]. [Problem Name]

**Difficulty:** [Easy/Medium/Hard]
**Link:** [LeetCode URL]

## Problem Description

[Brief description]

## Approach

[Your approach and algorithm]

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(?)
- **Space Complexity:** O(?)

## Notes

```

### Solution Code Guidelines

- **Include clear comments** explaining your logic
- **Add example test cases** in the main block
- **Use meaningful variable names**
- **Follow the language's style guide**

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

- **Folder names:** Use lowercase with hyphens
  - ✅ `1-two-sum`

  - Tests: `test.py`, `test.java`, `test.cpp`, etc.

### Code Quality

1. **Readability:** Write clean, readable code
2. **Comments:** Explain complex logic
3. **Testing:** Include test cases
4. **Complexity Analysis:** Document time and space complexity

### Documentation

1. **Problem Description:** Include a clear problem statement
2. **Approach:** Explain your thinking process
3. **Complexity:** Analyze time and space complexity
4. **Notes:** Add insights or alternative solutions

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Solve the problem** on LeetCode
2. **Create the folder structure**
3. **Add your solution and documentation**
4. **Test your solution** locally
5. **Commit and push** your changes
6. **GitHub Actions** will automatically update the progress stats
